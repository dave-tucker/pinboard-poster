pinboard-autoblogger
====================

You bookmark in pinboard and think "Hey, it would be a really cool idea if I could put my pinboard bookmarks in to a blog post". If this is you, then this is the project that will make your nerdy dreams come true.

## How it works

Simples. You adjust the settings in `config.py` to your liking and run `python-autoblog` and away you go.
